General-Templates
==========

This repository contains templates for
- Latex
- Illustrator
- Power Point
as well as pdfs by Jean-Luc Doumont about effective oral presentations and wirting (all rights reserved, you can find them for free at http://www.principiae.be/.
Most of the stuff is related to science and optics and was created/collected over the years of working with the programms.

#Latex
Contains a generic template to be used on Windows machines running MikTex in combination with Texniccenter. There are many added packgages and things that I concidered usefull. 
I will at some point add different templates for reports and thesis and maybe simple cover letters and a CV

#Illustrator
.ai files (and I will probably safe them as PDF or something more general at some point. Includes many parts of an optical setup that can be combined to create complex illustrations of experiments and such. 

# Power Point
More a rough sheets with advice on content and form, based on the PDF "Effective oral presentations" then an actuall template. I aggree with Jean-Luc in that the best presentation template is a blank page!
